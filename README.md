# Homepage Takeover

**This plugin is currently untested and is in active development.**

A simple WordPress plugin that allows admins and editors to manage homepage takeovers for promotions.

This plugin aims to provide a simple interface for creating and managing homepage takeovers. Currently you can set a background image to a clickable modal, control if the modal is active, set cookies, how long the cookie lasts and select whether the modal opens in a new tab or not.
